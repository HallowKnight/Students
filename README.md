Simple DDD and CQRS With MediatR + Small Examples of SignalR And RabbitMQ(MassTrasit) 
A Practical Project I made to :

1.Create a simple(as much as possible simple) project for DDD and CQRS,using MediatR,SignalR and RabbitMQ(Using MassTrasit) so other developers like me can use this to learn better(and maybe faster).

2.Learn The following : 
* DDD Architecture 
* CQRS Pattern
* MediatR
* SignalR
* RabitMQ
* MassTransit

This may not be a complete Project but I tried my best to develope as complete as I could so maybe I could help the developers who are searching for a sample project about the topics I said above.

I'm still working on new stuff to learn so maybe I update this code and add some more feature and stuff to it.
